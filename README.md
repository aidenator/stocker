# Stocker: A CLI based stock tracker
This program will show you an auto-updating overview of your stocks.
You can also view simple ASCII art graphs of each stock with various time ranges.

## Controls
* Use UP/DOWN keys (or J and K) for navigation. Select a stock with ENTER.
* This gets you into the graph view, you can navigate between various time ranges
* Exit the graph view with Q or Esc.
* Exit the program from the main view with Q or Esc.

## How?
This uses Yahoo Finance's undocumented API. Hopefully they won't care too much. Thanks Yahoo.

## Why?
I noticed there weren't any good CLI tools to follow stocks so I decided to make one.

## Bugs
* If your screen is too small, it will crash
* If you shrink your screen it might crash
* Certain Index Funds don't have enough granularity for a 1-Day graph (Eg: VTSAX)
