# Stocker: A CLI based stock tracker
I noticed there weren't any good CLI tools to follow stocks so I decided to make one.

## What does it do?
This program will show you an auto-updating overview of your stocks.
You can also view simple ASCII art graphs of each stock with various time ranges.

## Screenshots
